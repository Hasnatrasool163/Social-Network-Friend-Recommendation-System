Social Network Friend Recommendation System project is a fantastic way for students to apply graph theory concepts in a real-world context. Here’s an in-depth breakdown of this idea:
Project Overview
In this project, each user in a social network is represented as a node (or vertex) in a graph. Friend relationships are represented by edges connecting nodes. By constructing and traversing this graph, the system can offer useful social insights, such as mutual friends and friend recommendations. This mirrors the functionality of social media platforms that suggest friends based on shared connections.
Key Features and Functions
        ◦ Add Friends - Allow users to create friendships.
        ◦ Delete Friends - Allow users to break friendships.
        ◦ Display Mutual Friends - Help users find mutual friends they share with another user.
        ◦ Suggest Potential Friends Based on Common Connections - Recommend friends-of-friends, as they are likely to have more in common and be open to forming new connections.
        ◦ User Posting System- Allows users to make posts, which are stored and displayed in the order they were created, following an FCFS (queue-based) approach. This feature helps create a real-time feed of user activities.
